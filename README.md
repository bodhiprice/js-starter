# JavaScript Starter
This is a work in progress that can be used as a starting place for JavaScript projects. It makes use of:

- es6 syntax (using Babel)
- browserify
- eslint
- stylelint
- cssnext
- ghooks

A few notes: The CSS files are kept with their corresponding JS module rather than in a separate CSS folder. This makes it very easy to clean up the CSS if you delete a module. Prior to a commit, there are two linting tasks that are run - one for JS and another for CSS. The linting is handled by eslint and stylelint respectively.

Still working on this, but you can use `npm install` if you'd like to check it out.
